In this project, we did a circuit that has two 8-bit inputs and one 16-bit output to perform some tasks provided in CEN-415-432-project.pdf.
This folder has a code source and schematic design. Also, it has a report of the project for two phases and an implementation design made via the Magic VLSI layout tool.
The project was made by three students at King Saud University.
